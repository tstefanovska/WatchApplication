                                                 TV-Show Application
The purpose of this application is to help the users keep track of the TV-Shows they are currently watching, have already watched 
or want to watch. The user can create an account and search for shows by their name. They can also add trending shows to 
their lists. Everytime a user logs in, the app checks whether the shows that they're currently watching has an episode coming out 
that same day. If this is true, the user should receive a notification. It uses Room-database to keep the user's account
information and a Retrofit instance to get the TV-Shows data. It uses TheMovieDB as its source.
